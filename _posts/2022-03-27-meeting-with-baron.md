title: "Meeting with Baron"
---

We received following data after conversation with the AI:
1. Guiver received **big metal egg**, looks like storage device, probably hosts an AI
2. Fredd received list of various bounties (total of 1mln fb). On of the bounties stands out: bounty on uruk-har who escaped from detention. He was detained for the heist and bounty on him is too high (400k fb).
3. Dave received some information about himself. Also there some individuals who are looking for him.

Examining AI facility and Mutant Village yielded following results:
1. A lot of dead bodies were stored in vats underground.
2. Some of them were contaminated with nanomachines.
3. AI tried to heal (remove nanomachine contamination) mutants in the village.
4. We found **Jump Key** in the village.

After everything was we decided to go and discuss situation with **Baron**. **Tavok** wrote a letter of safe conduct for **Master Reid** (leader of the Mutant Village) so he can present his case. Before leaving we staged the destruction of mutants and their village so they can dissapear.
**Baron** knew **Master Reid** from the war. After the talks with Baron we received new lead: a warehouse in the city.
Assault on the warehouse was successful.
