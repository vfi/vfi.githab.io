title: Investigating Mutant Village
---
## Location: Criticorum
Party was investigating sattelite array which led to **Mutant Village**.
Interrogation fo *'Sleasy Guy'*:
1. Mutants dissapeared from around;
2. Think machine array waked up something, presumably supercomputer/AI;
3. Mutants, changed and kids are living together in **Mutant Village**;
4. Canisters (remnants of old technology) heal mutants;

Array of think machines was recording all activity around, including troupe movement. Troupe blew up wired connections to sattelite dishes to stop it.
After that troupe decided to go and investigate **Mutant Village**. They were expected there. **Mutant Village** houses old AI Facility.
Local AI was taking care of mutants and other denisens. It requested a meeting with troupe.
